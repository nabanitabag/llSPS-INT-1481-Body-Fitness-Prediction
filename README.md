Body Fitness Prediction

The motivation this project was to answer a simple question, “does exercise/working-out improve a person’s activeness?”. For the scope of this project a person’s activeness was 
the measure of their daily step-count. Mood was measured in either "Happy", "Neutral" or "Sad" which were given numeric values of 300, 200 and 100 respectively.
Feeling of activeness was measured in either "Active" or "Inactive" which were given numeric values of 500 and 0 respectively. Hours of sleep and weight of a person 
was also considered. It is usully assumed that during the months when people exercise regularly they feel more active and move around a lot more. As opposed to when 
not working out, they would feel lethargic. To know for sure what the connection between exercise and activeness was we used the data from Samsung Health application 
that records daily step count and the number of calories burned. The purpose of the project was to establish through two sets of data (control and experimental) 
if working-out/exercise promotes an increase in the daily step-count or not.
After applying various Machine Learning algorithms and training them on the dataset, a Flask Application has been created using Python, HTML and CSS.
